# GIST!

(Generic Immediate System for Tabletop)

CC-BY-SA 2022 by Roberto Bisceglie

Version 2.0

GIST! began as a design experiment aimed at implementing the "original 2d6 science fiction roleplaying game" as a generic setting-agnostic system. 
This second embodiment departs from its origins but maintain its core principles:
- Quick to read.
- 2d6 only.
- Index card character sheets.
- Easy-to-remember rules.
- Quick combat.
- Freeform magic.
- Hack friendly.

# What is GIST!

GIST! is a roleplaying game in which you will define an imagined space bounded by rules. Actions and events occur through procedure-driven player interaction. This facilitates an emergent shared narrative.

Put plainly, players will assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. The characters will act according to the rules of the game that will guarantee their success or failure. The outcome of actions will have an effect on the narrative that emerges.

A game of GIST! takes place as a conversation between the Referee and the other players.
- The Referee sets up the situation, describes the environment and setting, moves the dialogue and actions of the Non-Playing Characters.
- The Players move in the imagined space of the game through their Playing Character, describing their actions and narrating their conversations. It is up to each player to decide whether to act out their Character or play them impersonally. Players may also ask questions of clarification to the Referee.

To play you will need:
- At least 2 players, one will cover the role of Referee. The ideal number of players is 3-4 players, maximum 5.
- At least 2d6, preferably one set for each player.
- Writing instruments, index cards and sheets of paper for note-taking.

## Game Principles

It is important that everyone at the table feels comfortable and has the following principles in mind:
- This is a lightweight ruleset, designed to focus on fiction rather than mechanics. If you wish to engage mostly mechanics, there are other rulesets that will suit your taste.
- The Referee is a player like the others although with different duties. They should not take more responsibility for the success of the game than the other players at the table.
- The Referee does not play against other players, he merely adjudicates situations with respect to the context of the game.
- GIST! is designed for collaborative play, so competition between players should be discouraged. Characters act together to overcome challenges presented by the game world.
- Ask the referee questions clearly. The Referee should clearly present to the players the risks the characters take with each action.
- First describe the action and then only if needed roll the dice if the Referee requests it.

## Safety Tools

Just because you are gathered around a table do not assume that everyone will be comfortable with the issues addressed by the game or the actions of the other players. 

There are safety tools that will help you make the game comfortable before, during, and after the session.

### Before play
- [**Lines And Veils**](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/30906/what-do-the-terms-lines-and-veils-mean) (by Ron Edwards): Ask your players which contents make them feel uncomfortable and decide how to handle them. “Lines” are contents which they want to exclude from the plot completely. ”Veils” are topics which should only be part of the story in a softened, mitigated form. Offering the players suggestions helps to break the ice.
- **Content Warning**: Signal potentially critical topics in your story to your players before the start of the game. This is especially helpful at conventions, where a summary of your game session is shown on an online or offline notice board. In this way only players sign up who are comfortable with the contents of your scenario.
- **Tone Conversation**: Tell your players which in-game atmosphere you aim for. Examples are creepy, sad, dreamy or lighthearted. Clarifying this upfront helps to have everyone work towards the same mood in the scenario.
- **Open Door Policy**: Tell your players that they can leave your game session at any time, no questions asked. No matter if they feel uncomfortable with a certain topic of the story, or if they simply don’t enjoy the game, they can always stand up and say goodbye.
- [**C.A.T.S.**](http://proleary.com/2016/04/25/the-cats-method-a-story-telling-game-opening-ritual/) (by Patrick O’Leary) Give the players a rough summary of the game’s contents in four steps:
  1. Concept: What is the game about? Summary of the setting, characters and the main plot.
  2. Aim: What is the goal of the players? To overcome an enemy? Player-versus-player? Play-to-lose?
  3. Tone: Which kind of atmosphere do you want to achieve? Creepy, serious, goofy?
  4. Subject Matter: Discussing potentially critical topics, ask for your players’ consent.

### During Play

- [**X-Card**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SB0jsx34bWHZWbnNIVVuMjhDkrdFGo1_hSC2BWPlI3A/edit?usp=sharing) (by John Stavropoulos): Put a card or sheet of paper with a big X on it on the table. If someone taps the card or holds it up, this signals that the content of the current scene makes them feel uncomfortable. You should then quickly end this scene or change the topic. If necessary, it’s ok to ask the player to clarify. Other than that the player raising the X-Card is not meant to explain their reasons for doing so.
- [**Script Change**](https://briebeau.com/thoughty/script-change/) (by Beau Jágr Sheldon): Put a card or piece of paper on the table with these symbols on it: 1. Pause: Stop the game to ask questions and clarify details. 2. Fast backwards: Go back in time and adjust what has happened in the last few
moments in-game. 3. Fast forward: Quickly finish up the current scene or skip to the next one. When altering scenes with this tool, discussion is welcome and necessary to get consent from everyone at the table.
- **Check In**: During play simply ask another player, “Hey, is everything fine? Is the current scene ok with you?” The other one then replies with a Yes/No, thumb up or down, nodding or shaking their head. This lets you know if you can move forward with the current topic, or if you should take it more easy with this content or even end the scene quickly.

### After Play

- **Debrief**: Talk about everyone’s experiences with the game, tackle open questions and give each other feedback. This eases up some of the emotional tension that may have built up during play.
- **Roses and Thorns**: Ask your players these two questions: 1. Which part of the game did you like the most? 2. Which part of the game would you have done differently, if you could? Everyone takes a turn. As each player starts out with some positive feedback, it’s easier for them to provide some criticism afterwards.

# Character generation

GIST! involves competent characters facing dangers and challenges in a shrewd and proactive way. Its core is the character's background, aided by skills.

Both are determined freeform, but the Referee can help less savvy players by providing a list of both background and skills suitable for the setting, or help players define their character.

Character are streamlined and take only a few minutes to be made. Both playing and non-playing characters (including opponents) follow the same generation rules.

1. Roll 1d6-1d6 four times, divide by 2 and round off to the unit. Assign the scores to attributes as you wish.

2. Choose a background for the character. The character is able to do anything related to their background as a Skilled Level skill. Tools of the trade are also taken for granted.

3. Choose three skills and distribute among them 6 score points. The maximum score for a skill in character generation is 3.

4. Give to the character a name and their age. Choose two items as starting gear.

## Attributes

1. **Body**: both physical prowess (power and strength) and physical resistance (stamina and fatigue).

2. **Agility**: quickness, dexterity, deftness.

3. **Mind**: intelligence, common sense, creativity and knowledge.

4. **Soul**: emotional strength, personality, standing and spiritual power.

### Attribute Scores

An Attribute Score represents the Roll Modifier to apply to Checks and the Level to be used as a freeform qualitative indicator of the Attribute rank.

| Attribute Roll | Attribute Score | Attribute Level |
| -------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| -5             | -2              | Poor            |
| -4             | -2              | Poor            |
| -3             | -1              | Mediocre        |
| -2             | -1              | Mediocre        |
| -1             | 0               | Fair            |
| 0              | 0               | Fair            |
| +1             | 0               | Fair            |
| +2             | +1              | Good            |
| +3             | +1              | Good            |
| +4             | +2              | Great           |
| +5             | +2              | Great           |

Usually, a normal human being is limited to the maximum score of +2 (if any bonus is granted to the rolled score). Other beings may exceed this limit into the super-human domain. 

### Temporary scores

If circumstances impact negatively a character Attribute, its score may temporary drop to a lower Level. For example, when when a character with a Good Mind loses an intellectual challenge, their Mind may drop to Fair Level until it has recovered.

# Skills

Any useful skill, in a situation that requires a check, grants as roll modifier equal to its score. The total score of all the character's skill may not exceed twice the value of Mind score.

| Skill Score | Level        |
|:-----------:|:------------:|
| -1          | Unskilled    |
| 0           | Skilled      |
| 1           | Competent    |
| 2           | Professional |
| 3           | Veteran      |
| 4           | Master       |

If characters attempt something out of their competence, they are Unskilled and suffer a Roll Modifier of -1.

The tone and the granularity of the skills list is determined by the Referee consistently with the chosen setting and genre. The following is a generic list which can be modified and expanded as seen fit:

1. Athletic (agility, stamina, strength, sports)  

2. Artistic creativity, artist, musician, singer, actor) 

3. Intellectual (knowledge, wisdom, medicine) 

4. Magical (rituals, supernatural abilities)  

5. Martial (brawling, wrestling, combat, warfare)  

6. Primal (will, insight, fortitude, sixth sense)  

7. Skillful ("hands stuff", tracking, burglary, sailing)  

8. Social (speaking, carousing, gossip, etiquette)

# Action Resolution

Most of actions can be adjudicate from the context and how the player describes the character performing them. When the outcome is uncertain, however, the Referee may request a check:

1. **Opposition Check**: performed when two characters oppose one another. Both of them roll 1d6-1d6 and add modifiers, re-rolling ties. Who rolls higher wins.

2. **Difficulty Check**: performed, when the Referee determines a fixed difficulty, as follows:
   
   1. The Referee states the difficulty of the action, adding a situational modifier between - 2 and +2 to scale if needed
   
   2. The player rolls 1d6-1d6 and adds the roll modifiers granted by attribute, skills or gear.
   
   3. If the modified roll is equal or greater than 1, the action succeeds.

## Critical Rolls

A natural roll of -5 or +5 (without applying any modifier) is always a Critical Failure or Success, regardless of modifiers.

## Scaling Difficulty

If an action is inferred as trivial from the context of play, the Referee will avoid asking for a check.

If action is impossible, the Arbitrator can act in two ways:
1. separate the action into a chain of simpler actions
2. declare the action impossible and move the fiction forward.

If the action falls within the realm of possibility and requires a check, the Referee will consider whether a modifier should be applied to the shot according to the following scale. Most of the actions will be of Average Difficulty.

| Modifier | Difficulty |
|:--------:|:----------:|
|    - 2   |    Easy    |
|     0    |   Average  |
|     2    |    Hard    |

## Gear

The equipment provides an advantage within the fiction that results in a +1 bonus to the Check for each useful item in the action.

Gear can be damaged or lost within the context of the game. The Referee has the final word regarding this.

## Armor

Armor items grant a damage reduction ranging between 1 (light) and 3 (heavy), depending on the thickness.

# Combat

Combat is an action checked by Opposition, split up in rounds. Every round a character has two actions chosen from: move, attack, defense, use of powers. It is possible to perform a double action (of the same type) forgoing the other.

The combat procedure takes place as follows:

1. Each side determines initiative by rolling 1d6-1d6. Who rolls higher acts first. Agility and relevant skills modifier are applied to this roll.

2. On their turn, characters take their actions.

3. The round ends. Repeat steps 2-3 until the combat ends.

Once applied every relevant modifier (if a Critical is not rolled), the higher rolls wins.

Stat and Skills Modifiers are situational and depend also on the attack type. The Referee has to adjudicate which modifier is adequate to the situation.

## Damage

A character has a total of Hit Points equal twice the Body Score. 

Every time an attacks blows on an opponent, the difference between the rolls is applied to the losing side as damage. Armor reduce the damage by its score.

If the parrying opponent throws higher than the attacker, this does not apply as damage.

When HPs drops below zero, the character is severely wounded and unable to combat further. If a character blows on a severely wounded opponent, the latter may be dead or definitely out of combat. The winner chooses the opponent's final fate.

## Healing

After every combat, if HPs are higher than zero, they are immediately restored. If HPs are equal to zero, the character needs immediately medical treatment.

If the treatment is not feasible, the character make a Body Check against 1+. On success, HPs are restored by half the total. On failure the character must retire from action.

# Advancement

Every time a skill is remarkably challenged by the circumstances, the Referee may grant an Advancement roll to the player, rolling against 8+. On success, that particular skill gains an additional level.

# Freeform Magic

Everyone with Magical skill may try to cast a spell. Spells are invoked by wording a simple frase composed by a **focus** and a **locus**.

To cast a spell a player has to make a Magical Check against the difficulty set by the Referee.

As a baseline, here is the Difficulty level by Magical:

| Magical        | Difficulty |
| -------------- | ---------- |
| Unskilled      | Hopeless   |
| Skilled        | Very Hard  |
| Competent      | Hard       |
| Professional   | Routine    |
| Master         | Easy       |

Note that difficulty is situational and it is perfectly feasible in a desperate situation that even a Master may confront a Difficult task.

## Focus

There are five main foci a character must state to set a spell:

- **Convey**: to move/communicate

- **Feel**: to perceive/sense

- **Create**: to grow/mutate/heal

- **Control**: to manipulate/command/master

- **Destroy**: to weak/break/damage

## Locus

There are six possible loci for a spell:

- **Energy**: this include electricity and fire among others.

- **Matter**: every tangible and natural element such as objects, water, air and so on.

- **Time**: the space-time fabric, limited to the Dream.

- **Mind**: everything that deals with mental domains.

- **Body**: the physical part of a person or creature.

- **Soul**: everything that deals with spiritual force.

## Mishaps

Magical can be a overpowering skill or not, depending on the chosen setting. To balance the potential overpower of Magical skilled characters, the Referee may define **Mishaps** to make the use of magic more dangerous and risky.

Mishaps may be bland or severe and should cause injury, mutations or even the loss of Magical skill itself.

# Creatures and NPCs

Creatures are divided by size, having a different impact on their physical characteristics.
Sentient beings are effectively NPCs, but they have no limitations on characteristics and abilities like humans.
To build the other creatures, the reference table below may be useful.

| Size       | Might | Agility | Shape |
| ---------- | ----- | ------- | ----- |
| Tiny       | 1d3   | 1d6     | 1d3   |
| Small      | 1d6   | 1d6     | 1d6   |
| Medium     | 2d6   | 2d6     | 2d6   |
| Large      | 3d6   | 2d6+2   | 3d6   |
| Very Large | 4d6   | 2d6     | 4d6   |
| Massive    | 5d6   | 2d6-2   | 5d6   |
| Colossal   | 6d6   | 2d6-4   | 6d6   |

# For the Referee

A game of GIST! should be as much a challenge for a player as it is for the character.

The game is not based on a clear separation of player and character: what makes sense in the game context and what the character can reasonably know can be attempted.

Tactical infinity should be the main resolution engine of any action.
